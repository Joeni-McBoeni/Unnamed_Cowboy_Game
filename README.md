# Unnamed Cowboy Game
A tiny startegy game I made a while back. It's about two cowboys having a duel. Similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. Requires two players.

## Installation
Just download the folder, and open the following file:
cowboy_pew_pew\cowboy_pew_pew\bin\Debug.cowboy_pew_pew.exe

## How to play
Each player uses a set of numbers keys, with the player on the left using the regular ones and the player on the right using the numpad ones. Every number is tied to an action:

1 - Shoot (Deal 1 damage to your opponent & lose a bullet, unless you don't have any bullets)

2 - Dodge (Take no damage this turn)

3 - Reload (Gain a bullet, unless you already have six)

4 - Rest (Gain a life, unless your opponent shoots you or you already have six)

Combat resolves once both players have made their input for the round. When a player loses all of their lifes, the lose the game.
